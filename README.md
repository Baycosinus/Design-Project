My Design Project for Erciyes University Computer Engineering, a simple First-Person 3D Puzzle Game which will be developed in Unity 3D in C# Language.

All Visual assets belong to my talented friend Ty Alexander. You can (and should) check his art pages below:

# What is the point? 
    - This is a 3d Puzzle game, you need to solve puzzles in order to unlock doors and reach other rooms and eventually other puzzles. Since this is a limited-time demo, there is only two (and a half) puzzles. But i believe it's worth giving a try.
